				<p class="parag" id="main">Optical or photonic computing uses photons produced by lasers or diodes for computation. Currently, computers use semi conductor based 
				electronic parts or integrated circuits. Last year, scientists were able to make a huge step forward; for the first time ever, they were able to store optical based 
				information as sound waves on a computer chip. </p> 
				<p class="parag">Think of fibre optics - an internet connection using light to transmit information. Well, currently our computers 
				are unable to receive that information as light directly, thus needing to change it, slow it down to electric information before it is processed. This is not only 
				a huge decrease in performance, but efficiency as well.</p>

				<h3 id="subH1"> Photonic computing advantages:</h3>
				<p id="advantages"> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Potential to run at minimum 20x faster than current laptops/computers</li>
					<li>Less heat generated in the parts, increasing efficiency and reducing wear on parts</li>
					<li>Less energy usage</li>
				</ul>


				<h3 id="subH2">Photonic computing disadvantages:</h3>
				<p id="disadvantages"></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information stored as photons, too fast for existing microchips to read</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>New Breakthrough:</h3>

				<p class="parag"> Scientists as recently as last year were able to slow down the information stored as photons and convert it into sound. Photons, which might have 
				passed through the chip in 2-3ms, now is slow enough as sound to be processsed by new microschips that are being tested. "The information in our chip in acoustic 
				form travels at a velocity five orders of magnitude slower than in the optical domain," said project supervisor Birgit Stiller at the time. Team member Moritz 
				Merklein added: "For [light-based computers] to become a commercial reality, photonic data on the chip needs to be slowed down so that they can be processed, 
				routed, stored and accessed."</p>

				<p class="parag"> The team did this by developing a memory system that accurately transfers between light and sound waves on a photonic microchip - the kind of chip 
				that will be used in light-based computers. The fact that the team was able to convert the light into sound waves not only slowed it down, but also made data 
				retrieval more accurate. </p>
